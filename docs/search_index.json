Since many institutions do not have the resources to offer complete courses on VA, it was decided that standalone lessons plans have the potential for more use and dissemination. Intent: These modules are designed to help participants: Understand the definition and value of visual analytics Explain and use design principles for visual analytics Use visual analytics to explore and reach a decision for a problem Use: The first part is a stand alone module that could be used as one or two lessons. The final part is a case study that ….. "],
["who-is-this-book-for.html", "0.1 Who is this book for?", " 0.1 Who is this book for? I designed these notes for the instructor who wants to adopt a course that combines elements of a traditional mathematical statistics course with more computational and programming emphasis. My subsequent course is a machine learning course and this course has provided my students with a solid foundation to approach that next course. I think these notes will aid any instructor in getting a course with Prium’s book up and running in a short amount of time. "],
["book-structure-and-how-to-use-it.html", "0.2 Book Structure and How to Use It", " 0.2 Book Structure and How to Use It In Appendix A, I have provided my syllabus as an example of how to use the notes. This syllabus is based on 40 lessons each of 53 minutes long. Obviously this will have to altered based on the length of course you want to run. I aligned these notes with the chapters in Prium’s textbook. Within each chapter there are subsections for each lesson. These match the lessons in the syllabus in Appendix A. Every lesson starts with administrative tasks to cover topics such as upcoming exams, points from previous class that need clarification, and homework questions. For example, in one lesson I reviewed an RMarkdown cheat sheet, answered one homework questions, and answered a question on running swirl. In the notes I have excluded the admin section but be aware that I have one for each lesson. I have shortened chapter 5 to allow a brief introduction to linear regression in chapter 6. The speed of the course is fast and I have had to make some difficult decisions about what to include and exclude. I typically include 4 exams in addition to a final. I leave the lesson before the exam as a review and catch-up day. Thus the 4 exams and 4 review lessons take 8 lessons. The course is fast so I don’t mind putting these extra lessons into the design. I also include a project I have used in Appendix B. "],
["prerequisites.html", "0.3 Prerequisites", " 0.3 Prerequisites To take my course, students are expected to have completed calculus up through and including multivariate calculus. I don’t assume they have any programming experience and thus I have used the swirl package to help them get started in R. I have the students load and run R locally on their personal computers and we also use Rstudio as the IDE for our work. These notes make use of the following packages in R knitr (Xie 2017b), rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2017), fastR (Pruim 2017), Hmisc (Harrell 2018), lattice (Sarkar 2017), vcd (Meyer, Zeileis, and Hornik 2017), ggplot2 (Wickham and Chang 2016), MASS (Ripley 2017), TeachingDemos (Snow 2016), Stat2Data (Lock 2013), car (Fox and Weisberg 2017), DT (Xie 2016),crosstalk (Cheng 2016), leaflet (Cheng, Karambelkar, and Xie 2017), plotly (Sievert et al. 2017).

The remaining chapters give in-depth lessons into each of the three knowledge areas, analytic reasoning, visualization, and interaction. The depth that the instructor uses depends on how much time can be devoted to this lesson. This lesson could be done in a little as 30 minutes or as much as three 50 minute lessons. These notes are broken into sections. Under each section are definitions, explanations, discussion ideas, and problems. "],

["lesson-introduction.html", "1.2 Lesson Introduction", " 1.2 Lesson Introduction Sugestions to start the lesson are: Start the lesson by having the participants discuss the videos and explain insights gained for the preparation work.. One of the objectives is to define and explain visual analytics. A useful definition is (this can be given or developed by asking students for input): Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. Discussion ideas and points for this portion of the lesson include: The goal of visual analytics is to create software systems that will support the analytical reasoning process. Visual analytics can be broken down into a form of analytical reasoning that relies on visual displays that are interactive. We must in turn explore and understand analytical reasoning, visual representation of data, and interactive interfaces. This is a lead into the rest of this lesson. "],
["analytic-reasoning.html", "1.3 Analytic Reasoning", " 1.3 Analytic Reasoning Explain analytic reasoning. Below are some ideas to help the instructor. The goal of analysis is to make a decision about a question. This question can be part of a larger analysis problem with many questions. Analytic reasoning requires reasoning logically with the support of numeric evidence. The analyst must understand the limitations of the data and the assumptions of the data transformations and summaries. Many analytical reasoning tasks follow a process of • Information gathering • Re-representation of the information in a form that aids analysis • Development of insight through the manipulation of this representation • Creation of some knowledge product or direct action based on the knowledge insight. This is true of visual analytics except the representation will be visual and interactive. Use an example to highlight the ideas and principles. We will use this example for the remainder of the lesson. The example should be easy to understand and allow us to present important concepts of visual analytics. The instructor can pick an example of their own, and some ideas are presented, but we will use the baseball example for the remainder of this part. "],
