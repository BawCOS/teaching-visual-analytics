## Who is this book for?



## Book Structure and How to Use It

Introduction:  This is a work is the result of an effort between the VACCINE lab at Purdue University and the United States Air Force Academy to develop a smaller set of lesson to introduce the field of visual analytics (VA).  Since many institutions do not have the resources to offer complete courses on VA, it was decided that standalone lessons plans have the potential for more use and dissemination.   

Intent:  These modules are designed to help participants:
Understand the definition and value of visual analytics
Explain and use design principles for visual analytics
Use visual analytics to explore and reach a decision for a problem

Use:  The first part is a stand alone module that could be used as one or two lessons.  The final part is a case study that â€¦..
