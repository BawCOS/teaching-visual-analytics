# Introducing Visual Analytics {#Chpt1}

This part is a short introduction to visual analytics. The remaining chapters give in-depth lessons into each of the three knowledge areas, analytic reasoning, visualization, and interaction. The depth that the instructor uses depends on how much time can be devoted to this lesson.  This lesson could be done in a little as 30 minutes or as much as three 50 minute lessons.  These notes are broken into sections.  Under each section are definitions, explanations, discussion ideas, and problems.

## Lesson Introduction

Suggestions to start the lesson are:

1.  Start the lesson by having the participants discuss the videos and explain insights gained for the preparation work..

2.  One of the objectives is to define and explain visual analytics.  A useful definition is (this can be given or developed by asking students for input): Visual analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces.  

3) Discussion ideas and points for this portion of the lesson include:    
a) The goal of visual analytics is to create software systems that will support the analytical reasoning process.    
b) Visual analytics can be broken down into a form of analytical reasoning that relies on visual displays that are interactive.    
c) We must in turn explore and understand analytical reasoning, visual representation of data, and interactive interfaces.  This is a lead into the rest of this lesson.

Below is a diagram of the visual analytics process. It is a cycle where any one particular step can be a starting point, and ending point, and a transition point to another area of the cycle. For this lesson we will assume you start with a hypothesis and thus start with analytical reasoning. It is important to note that this is not always the case. You could start with data visualization in an exploratory manner and then move to either analytic reasoning or data visualization.

## Analytic Reasoning  

This section introduces the concept of analytics reasoning and then uses an example to illustrate the ideas.

### Analytic Reasoing Explained.

This section contains some ideas to help the instructor introduce the topic of analytic reasoning.

The goal of analysis is to make a decision about a question.  This question can be part of a larger analysis problem with many questions.  Analytic reasoning requires reasoning logically with the support of numeric evidence.  The analyst must understand the limitations of the data and the assumptions of the data transformations and summaries.

Many analytical reasoning tasks follow a process of
• Information gathering
• Re-representation of the information in a form that aids analysis
• Development of insight through the manipulation of this representation
• Creation of some knowledge product or direct action based on the knowledge
insight.

This is true of visual analytics except the representation will be visual and interactive.

### Example

We will an example to highlight the ideas and principles.  We will use this example for the remainder of the lesson.  The example should be easy to understand and allow us to present important concepts of visual analytics.  The instructor can pick an example of their own, and some ideas are presented later.   

#### Problem:  

Often in baseball teams and fans want to compare players.  In the 1990s two extremely good players were Derek Jeter of the New York Yankees and David Justice of the Atlanta Braves.  

#### Question: 

Who was the better baseball player?  Take some time and discuss how to answer the question.

#### Discussion ideas:  

There are many ways to try to answer this question.  Someone might say that Jetter was paid more therefore he is better.  Or someone would say that the Yankees are a better team and thus Jetter is better.  This is known as butterfly reasoning 

### Second Example  

As another example but this time using a social context is the University of California - Berkeley admission bias question.  Running this as a lesson would look like this:

#### Problem:  

In the early 1970s there was a concern that the University of California - Berkeley was discriminating in its admissions process based on gender.  Question: How do we decide if Cal-Berkeley is practicing discrimination based on gender?  Take some time and discuss how to answer the question.

#### Discussion ideas:  

There are many ways to try to answer this question.  Someone might say that Berkeley had to be because this was the early 1970s and we know that institutional bias against women was common.  This is known as butterfly reasoning.  This is not analytical reasoning.  We must collect some data that will help us in deciding the answer.  In practice the is an iterative process.  

### Other problem ideas:  

i) In mathematics, deciding if a function is continuous at a point.  Generate a visual of a function and have an epsilon selected at random.  The decision maker must determine if there is a delta such that for all the points inside delta of x, the function is within epsilon of the limit.  
ii) In political science, we could use voter data to ask questions about coastal states versus central states.
iii) In biology, we could look at sports data such as Olympic race times.
iv) ...

### Using analytic reasoning.  

We need data and a metric to help us answer the question of who is the better batter. Some data and background for this problem are here.  In analytic reasoning, we often need to transform and summarize data.  One approach is to use a decimal representation the fraction of the number of hits.  We have two years of data, we could get more but we want to keep the example simple, and below is the transformation and summary of the data.

Discussion ideas:  Who is the better batter?  What concerns do you have with this summary and data transformation?  If we switched the two rows, would that lead to a different impression of the data (this is a lead into visualization)?






1995
1996
Derek Jeter
0.250
0.314
David Justice
0.253
0.321

This transformation loses too much information; that is the problem of using a decimal.  We don’t know how many times each player batted.  Here is a summary of the ratio of hits to at bats for each year.



1995
1996
Derek Jeter
12/48
183/582
David Justice
104/411
45/140

Discussion ideas:  Who is the better batter? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this summary compared to the last?

Now let’s look at combining years.  One way that is tempting is to take a simple average of the the two years.  This is wrong as the number of at bats is not the same.  Below is the table for the combined years.



Combined
Average
Derek Jeter
195/630
0.300
David Justice
149/551
0.270

Discussion ideas: Now, based on average, it appears that Derek Jeter is the better batter.  What happened?  Who is the better batter and why?  

Let’s find another way to visualize the data besides counts in a table.

## Visualizing data 

i) Background information to help introduction the idea.

Data visualization is a complicated and important subject.  You can get advanced degrees in the subject.  We will only give the basics principles and ideas in this section.  There are three things should always inform the visual summary that you select and/or design.  First, you as the creator must decide which ideas are important to communicate to the reader.  Second, what is the reader’s background and how will they understand or what will they take away from the visualization?  Tufte states that you should “respect your audience not know them.” Finally, what kind of data is it, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the data, what information is contained in the data, and what tools are needed to visualize this data?

The first point requires you to identify your key message, filter and summarize the data to a point that maintains that message without over-compressing the data, and finally think about how to communicate this idea.  A key point here is whether the visualization is for exploration and analysis or presentation of results. The second point is to understand such factors as short-term memory limits the amount of information a reader can hold and preattentive thought picks up position, motion, shape, and color first.  The design should understand how a reader picks up these preattentive attributes.  Finally, the last point has you putting everything together.  For example, color does a nice job with discrete variables although it could be used as a gradient for continuous variables.  Length is good for continuous variables.  Area is difficult for readers to compare.  

ii) Using ideas on our problem

In the batting average problem, we have compressed the results of individual bats into an average.  There was also the choice to leave year as a separate variable or to compress further into a single summary.  The compression to a batting average lost an important element of the data and that is the magnitude of number of bats.  Understanding our reader, we should know that most people will compare the value of the batting averages equally, that is that assume that the number of at bats is approximately equal.  Thus, in this example they will either compare Derek Jeter against David Justice each year or simply average the two years into a single number to make a decision on the better batter.  In either case, the reader may conclude that David Justice is the better batter.  

Discussion ideas: The tables in the previous section are visual summaries but what are the limitations?  What are the key idea(s) for this problem?  How would you visualize this data?

iii) Visualization

Since batting average is more a quantitative variable than a qualitative, we decided to use position to represent batting average.  The x-axis is the number of batting attempts and the y-axis is the number of hits.  The average is the angle, or the slope of the line. Angles are difficult to estimate but easy to compare.  We used color to separate the two batters only for the combined years.  We included the individual year breakdown but they are difficult to see.  We included points to bring them out.  The combination of years, or the calculation of combined batting average, is a vector addition and not the addition of fractions.  Vectors have both direction and length.  The direction is the number of hits over number of at bats, the traditional batting average.  The length is related to the number of at bats.  The plot shows that Derek Jeter’s combined batting average gets pulled more towards the second year when he had more at bats.  The opposite is true for David Justice and that is why we get the reversal. 



This might be hard to see in the document so you can open it separately as pdf to see the design better.  The link is http://bit.ly/2tP05tU 

Discussion question: What do you like about the plot?  What are the strengths and weaknesses? What changes would you make?  Is it better to put the players’ years end to end or does that hide that David Justice is better in each individual year? Does the color help or hurt?

Note for discussion: The angle is the batting average, should we use white space and put an explanation into the graph?  What if we had three years, how would we represent them? The labels overlap the lines, should we move them?  Hook to next lesson: interaction could help us by selecting a year and turning it off or make more transparent.  This question will lead to interaction section.


## Interaction  

i) Background information to introduce the topic.

The purpose of interaction in a visual display of data is the aid in the decision process.  It can be used to explain a concept, develop conjectures or insights, and/or facilitate an exploration.  This can lead to increased efficiencies and effectiveness of the decision making process. However, the science of understanding and implementing interaction is the least developed of the three areas.  This is partly due to the only recent availability of software to easily develop customized interactive displays.

The general principle of interaction is summarized as overview first, zoom on interest, filter to make specific, and provide details as required.  Interaction can add in decision making because by interacting with the data; the analyst and decision maker can transform data, alter visual display, and then form hypothesis or alter conditions to determine impact.

The biggest issue with interactivity is the ability to rapidly develop custom products.  Currently this require programming skills and sophisticated software. This will change, and has to some extent with packages such as Tableau, as more tools are developed that remove the need to program.  

ii) Simple example.

The following site has an example of a simple interactive visualization to help understand the effectiveness of an interactive to present an idea.

https://hbr.org/2014/04/what-the-scarcity-of-women-in-business-case-studies-really-looks-like 

Discussion ideas:  What are the thoughts of the speed of the interaction?  Did the animation help or hurt?  What key idea did the authors want the reader to leave with from this visualization?  What good make it better.

iii) Our batting problem.

Without developing our own custom visualization, which we could have done in geogebra, we decided to find an existing application.  There is an interactive visualization application in the geogebra library, go to https://www.geogebra.org/m/YrPAV6KK.  The example uses shooting baskets but gives the same idea as the reversal we saw in our problem.  We selected this interaction becomes it helps explain why the reversal occurs and the conditions under which it occurs.  

Discussion ideas:  Have the participants move Lucy1 around by experimenting with the length and angle to determine when the reversal occurs.  What is the relationship between angle and the reversal?  What is the relationship between length and reversal?  Is it possible to have Tom as the better shooter regardless of Lucy’s actions as long as Lucy’s first and second day performances are less than Tom’s?  What are the strengths of the interaction?  What would have to be done to use it for our data?
