Since many institutions do not have the resources to offer complete courses on VA, it was decided that standalone lessons plans have the potential for more use and dissemination. Intent: These modules are designed to help participants: Understand the definition and value of visual analytics Explain and use design principles for visual analytics Use visual analytics to explore and reach a decision for a problem Use: The first part is a stand alone module that could be used as one or two lessons. The final part is a case study that ….. "],
["who-is-this-book-for.html", "0.1 Who is this book for?", " 0.1 Who is this book for? I designed these notes for the instructor who wants to adopt a course that combines elements of a traditional mathematical statistics course with more computational and programming emphasis. My subsequent course is a machine learning course and this course has provided my students with a solid foundation to approach that next course. I think these notes will aid any instructor in getting a course with Prium’s book up and running in a short amount of time. "],
["book-structure-and-how-to-use-it.html", "0.2 Book Structure and How to Use It", " 0.2 Book Structure and How to Use It In Appendix ??, I have provided my syllabus as an example of how to use the notes. This syllabus is based on 40 lessons each of 53 minutes long. Obviously this will have to altered based on the length of course you want to run. I aligned these notes with the chapters in Prium’s textbook. Within each chapter there are subsections for each lesson. These match the lessons in the syllabus in Appendix ??. Every lesson starts with administrative tasks to cover topics such as upcoming exams, points from previous class that need clarification, and homework questions. For example, in one lesson I reviewed an RMarkdown cheat sheet, answered one homework questions, and answered a question on running swirl. In the notes I have excluded the admin section but be aware that I have one for each lesson. I have shortened chapter 5 to allow a brief introduction to linear regression in chapter 6. The speed of the course is fast and I have had to make some difficult decisions about what to include and exclude. I typically include 4 exams in addition to a final. I leave the lesson before the exam as a review and catch-up day. Thus the 4 exams and 4 review lessons take 8 lessons. The course is fast so I don’t mind putting these extra lessons into the design. I also include a project I have used in Appendix ??. "],
["prerequisites.html", "0.3 Prerequisites", " 0.3 Prerequisites To take my course, students are expected to have completed calculus up through and including multivariate calculus. I don’t assume they have any programming experience and thus I have used the swirl package to help them get started in R. I have the students load and run R locally on their personal computers and we also use Rstudio as the IDE for our work. These notes make use of the following packages in R knitr (Xie 2017b), rmarkdown (Allaire et al. 2017), fastR (Pruim 2017), Hmisc (Harrell 2018), lattice (Sarkar 2017), vcd (Meyer, Zeileis, and Hornik 2017), ggplot2 (Wickham and Chang 2016), MASS (Ripley 2017), TeachingDemos (Snow 2016), Stat2Data (Lock 2013), car (Fox and Weisberg 2017), DT (Xie 2016).
